This is just the list of what i vaguely want
- Working engine
	- [[Task1 - Refactoring]]
	- [[Task2 - Add Scene System]]
	- Update Cycle is defined by Engine, not Consuming Code
		- [[Task7 - Move Update Cycle to Engine]]
- Region system like in Minecraft
	- [[TaskX - Refactor Tile System]]
	- [[TaskX+1 - Remake Tile System to support regions]]
- Misc
	- Camera support render to not only the screen[^1]
	- Expand debug screen
		- [[Task13 - Add runtime counter]]

[^1]: it probably is quite easy, i should just search for how to render to texture in opengl
