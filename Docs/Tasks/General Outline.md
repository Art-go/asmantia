This is just the list of what i vaguely want
- Working engine
	- [[Task1 - Refactoring Engine Into Separate Package]]
		- [[Task14 - Test1 - Writing snake to see how it will ]]
	- [[Task2 - Add Scene System]]
- Region system like in Minecraft
	- [[TaskX - Refactor Tile System]]
	- [[TaskX+1 - Remake Tile System to support regions]]
- Misc
	- Camera support render to not only the screen[^1]
	- Expand debug screen
		- [[Task13 - Add runtime counter]]

[^1]: it probably is quite easy, i should just search for how to render to texture in opengl
