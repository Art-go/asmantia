>[!tldr] Quick Description
>Move an Update Cycle from client.py to Engine, maybe something like Runtime.py

## Steps
- [ ] Move Update Cycle inside of Engine
	- [ ] Make rendering cycle be handled by engine
		- [ ] [[Task2 - Add Scene System]] Would probably be required to make it all work properly
