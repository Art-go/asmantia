>[!tldr] Quick Description
>So ui is 1. Not rendering everything 2. the only this what is being rendered.... is renderer with world pos

## Steps
1. [ ] i'm pretty sure [[Task10 - Remake Obj so it renders children]] would probably be enough.... idk tho
2. [x] Investigate [^1]
	- [x] And fix
## Relevant new tasks
- ...i really hope where wouldn't be any

[^1]: Report:
	...............i am just resetting it before actually rendering it all, so doing [[Task5 - Refactor queue in GLUtils into separate class#^3eacbc]] should fix it
